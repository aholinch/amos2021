# SGP4-XP TLEs 
Each file contains TLEs for the satellites studied in our paper on the new SGP4-XP propagator.

The TLEs use 99999 as the object number, there are no international IDs, no elset nums, no epoch nums, and no computed check sums.

Where the RMS increases, it is likely that the fit span includes a maneuver.
